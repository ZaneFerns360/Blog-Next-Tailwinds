# Virtualbox stuck at 20%?

## Don't worry there is a quick fix: Disable Intel IBT

IBT is an Intel based technology meant to protect the kernel from making extensive use of indirect branches.
IBT is meant as a defense against jump-oriented programming; it works by trying to ensure that the target of every indirect branch is, in fact, intended to be reached that way.  

Unfortunately using IBT creates problems with non standard kernel modules like the VirtualBox kernel modules on Fedora & Arch linux distros.
## Fire up the terminal and input the commands:

- Example of the fix for Fedora: 
```
sudo grubby --args=ibt=off --update-kernel 
/boot/vmlinuz-6.3.11-200.fc38.x86_64
```

- For Permanent fix:
Add it to /etc/default/grub like this:
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=
"loglevel=3 quiet ibt=off"
```
then run:
```
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
